# Student-Registration
Reads from a text file that contains student data and stores it in to an array. Users are also able to add, edit, and delete student and course data. The student data consists of first name, last name, ID, total credits taken, list of courses, and GPA. Course data consists of course number, credit hours, and grade received. If a new student is manually added through a user (rather than the text file), the program will calculate the studentâ€™s GPA based on the received grade and credit for each class. Additionally, if a course is added or deleted from that student, the GPA will be readjusted. Data is displayed in a GUI where buttons are used to achieve each function (add, delete, display, etc.).
